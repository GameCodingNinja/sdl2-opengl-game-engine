Instructions on how to build this Android app from command line on Linux

1) cd into the root folder of the project
2) To build the native code: ndk-build -j2
3) Now build the Java part: ant debug
4) To install on device: ant debug install

5) To clean the native code part of the project: ndk-build clean


Run in debug mode on phone

1) Install Eclipse for C/C++
2) Install ADT plugin for Android development
   ADT Plugin
   https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
3) Needed to install ncurses-5 because it was needed by the dubugger.
   Ended up just downloading an RPM and extracted to my root drive.
4) Works better if you Import an existing Android app from the file menu.
   Right click on the project, choose Android Tools, Add Native Support.
5) From the Project menu do "clean..." and "Build All". Won't debug if built from command line
